# Final Project – Responsive Hotel Website

This project is a responsive hotel-themed website inspired by a layout mockup. It includes multiple sections like navigation, testimonials, contact form, and FAQ, with responsive designs and interactive elements.

## 🎨 Color System

- **Primary Color:** `#2E86AB` – used for headers, buttons, and key highlights. It offers a calming, trustworthy look often associated with hospitality.
- **Accent Color:** `#F26419` – used for calls-to-action to draw user attention.
- **Neutral Background:** `#F7F7F7` – soft light gray used for sections to improve readability and provide contrast.
- **Text Color:** `#222222` – used for headings and body content to ensure strong readability.

### Rationale

Colors were chosen for strong visual contrast and professional feel, suitable for a hotel brand. The goal was to be modern but warm and inviting.

## 🔁 Breakpoint Logic (Responsive Design)

- **LG (≥1024px):** Full 3-column layout, complete navigation bar visible, side-by-side sections.
- **MD (≤768px):** Switches to 2-column grid layout. Elements like cards stack in rows for better legibility.
- **SM (≤480px):** Full single-column layout, with all sections stacked vertically. Menu collapses into mobile layout if required.

All layout adaptations were done using **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**, supported by media queries.

## ✨ Creative Divergence from Mockup

- **Theme Rebranding:** Switched from the original wellness mockup to a **hotel/hospitality** theme.
- **Custom Content:** Replaced generic placeholder content with hotel-specific messaging, contact form, testimonials, and booking encouragement.
- **Enhanced Contact Section:** Includes message box and optional image upload, styled with a border and contrast for emphasis.
- **Extra Features:** "Explore More" and "Join Us" sections with consistent styling and mobile adaptability.
- **Fully commented code** with clear structure for maintainability.
